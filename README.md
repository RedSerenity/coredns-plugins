# CoreDNS Plugins

---

The plugins were taken from:
* [pdsql](https://coredns.io/explugins/pdsql/) ([Github](https://github.com/wenerme/wps))
* [redis](https://coredns.io/explugins/redis/) ([Github](https://github.com/arvancloud/redis))
* [redisc](https://coredns.io/explugins/redisc/) ([Github](https://github.com/miekg/redis))

and updated because they were not working with the latest CoreDNS (v.1.8.3)
